# Surfs Up

## Project Overview


## Purpose of this Analysis
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Analysis Steps

2. In Step 2, convert the June temperatures to a list.
3. In Step 3, create a DataFrame from the list of temperatures for the month of June.
4. In Step 4, generate the summary statistics for the June temperatures DataFrame.
